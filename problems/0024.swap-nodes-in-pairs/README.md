# 24.Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

Example:

```
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
```

Note:

Your algorithm should use only constant extra space.
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
